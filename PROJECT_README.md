## How to Add Team Leaders' Image

To add the image of Nolly and Paul Santiago to the About Us section:

1. **Convert the Image**: Convert your HEIC file to a JPEG or PNG format if needed (there are free online converters available)

2. **Upload the Image**: Place the converted image in the `/public` folder of this project
   - Name the image file something descriptive like `santiago-team-leaders.jpg`

3. **Update the Code**: In `client/src/components/AboutUs.tsx`, find and edit the following section:
   - Uncomment the `<img>` tag (around line 76-80)
   - Update the `src` attribute to point to your image file (e.g., `src="/santiago-team-leaders.jpg"`)

```jsx
{/* Once you have the image, uncomment this line and update the src path */}
<img 
  src="/santiago-team-leaders.jpg" 
  alt="Nolly and Paul Santiago" 
  className="w-full h-full object-cover"
/>
```

4. **Remove the Instructions**: You can remove the instructions div (the one with "Manual Image Integration" text) once your image is working properly
