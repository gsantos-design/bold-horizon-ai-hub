I noticed {COMPANY} has been growing steadily in {INDUSTRY}. Congratulations on that momentum!

I'm Pablo Santiago with WFG, and I've been helping business leaders like yourself create multiple income streams that often 5x-10x their current revenue through systematic approaches.

Just last month, one of our partners went from $180K annually to over $600K using our proven system - without working more hours.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how leaders in {INDUSTRY} are building these additional revenue streams?

Following up on my message about revenue multiplication strategies.

Here's that case study I mentioned: Maria was running a successful consulting firm in {INDUSTRY}, making about $200K annually. She joined our Santiago Team system 18 months ago.

Today she's generated over $850K in combined income:
• Her original business: $220K (grew 10%)
• WFG system income: $630K (new stream)

The key? She didn't change her core business. She added a systematic approach to wealth building that now generates 3x her original income.

I'd love to show you exactly how this works. Are you available for a 15-minute conversation this week?

I know you're busy running {COMPANY}, so I'll keep this brief.

Last week, I shared how leaders in {INDUSTRY} are systematically building additional income streams that often exceed their primary business revenue.

Since I haven't heard back, I'm guessing either:
1. The timing isn't right
2. You're not interested in additional revenue streams
3. My emails got buried (happens to the best of us!)

If it's #3, here's one last opportunity to see how Nolly and I have helped hundreds of professionals add $300K-$800K annually to their income:

If it's #1 or #2, no worries at all - I'll stop following up.

Either way, continued success with {COMPANY}!

I hope this finds you well in your entrepreneurial journey with {COMPANY}.

Quick question: If I could show you a proven system that entrepreneurs like yourself are using to add $100K-$250K in additional annual income - without disrupting your current business - would that be worth a 15-minute conversation?

Here's what makes this different:
• 90% success rate for qualified entrepreneurs
• Average additional income: $180K in first 18 months
• Leverages your existing network and skills
• Completely separate from your current business

This isn't theory - yesterday I got a text from Marcus (e-commerce founder) showing his $23K month from our system... while his main business grew 40%.

The system works because:
1. You already understand business fundamentals
2. You have established credibility and relationships  
3. You know how to execute and follow systems

{FIRST_NAME}, I only work with serious entrepreneurs who see the value in multiple income streams. Are you someone who thinks strategically about building wealth beyond just one business?

If yes, let's have a brief conversation this week. I'll show you exactly how the system works and you can decide if it's a fit.

      content: `{FIRST_NAME},

Following up on my message about the additional income system for entrepreneurs.

Since you're in {INDUSTRY}, I wanted to share a specific case study that might resonate:

**Sarah - Digital Marketing Agency Owner**
- Original business: $320K annually
- Added using our system: $247K in 14 months
- Total income: $567K (77% increase)
- Time investment: 8-10 hours/week initially, now 4-5 hours

What Sarah discovered:
"I was skeptical about adding another income stream. I thought it would distract from my agency. The opposite happened - the financial principles I learned actually improved my core business. Plus, the additional $247K gave me the confidence to hire better talent and invest in growth."

The key insight: High-performing entrepreneurs succeed in our system because you already have the three critical factors:
1. **Systems thinking** - You understand how to build processes
2. **Relationship capital** - You have credibility and connections
3. **Execution discipline** - You know how to follow through

{FIRST_NAME}, this system has a 90% success rate with qualified entrepreneurs because it's designed around these strengths you already possess.

Interested in seeing exactly how Sarah did it? I can walk you through the complete system in 15 minutes.

      content: `{FIRST_NAME},

This is my final message about the entrepreneur income system.

I've reached out because successful business owners like yourself in {INDUSTRY} have the exact profile that succeeds with our $100K-$250K additional income system.

Quick reality check:
• 90% of entrepreneurs who see this system join within 30 days
• Average additional income: $180K in first 18 months  
• None have regretted the decision

Since I haven't heard back, I'm guessing:
❌ You're too busy (I get it)
❌ You're skeptical (understandable)
❌ My emails got lost (happens)
✅ You want to see the details before deciding

If it's the last one, here's what happens next:

**15-Minute Call Agenda:**
1. I'll show you the exact 4-step system (5 minutes)
2. Walk through 3 entrepreneur case studies in your industry (5 minutes)  
3. Answer your specific questions (5 minutes)

No pitch. No pressure. Just information so you can make an informed decision.

Or call/text me directly: 407-777-1087

{FIRST_NAME}, in 12 months you'll either:
• Have added $100K-$250K to your annual income
• Wish you had taken 15 minutes to explore this opportunity

The choice is yours.
