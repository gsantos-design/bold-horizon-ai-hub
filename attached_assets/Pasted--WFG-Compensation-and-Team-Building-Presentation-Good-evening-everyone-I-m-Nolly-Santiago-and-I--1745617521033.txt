# WFG Compensation and Team Building Presentation

Good evening everyone! I'm Nolly Santiago, and I'm excited to share with you our compensation structure and the incredible opportunities available at WFG in 2025.

## For Our Newest Team Members

If you've been with us less than six months, please pay special attention. Even if you've heard some of this before, understanding our compensation model is crucial to your success.

The average policy our company closes is approximately $250 monthly premium. While some of us work in markets with higher premiums—$500, $1,000, or even $10,000 monthly—and others work in markets with lower premiums of $50-75 monthly, let's use $250 as our example.

## Commission Structure

As you progress through our ranks, your commission percentage increases:
- Training Associate: 30%
- Associate: 45% 
- Senior Associate: 55%
- Marketing Director: 62%

I personally reached Marketing Director in my first month. If that wasn't your experience, that's perfectly fine—many successful leaders in our organization achieve this milestone at different paces.

## Calculating Your Compensation

Your compensation is calculated by multiplying the monthly premium by 12 months, then applying your commission percentage based on your current level.

**Important note:** We'll provide everyone with a USB drive containing all presentation materials from today's meeting. This allows you to focus on absorbing the content rather than frantically taking notes.

## Commission Payout Methods

For new agents especially, understanding how we get paid is essential:

**Advanced Commission Option 1:**
- Submit application with premium
- Receive 40% advance within one week
- After policy approval (3-4 weeks), deliver policy to client
- Receive remaining 60% advance after delivery requirements are submitted

**Advanced Commission Option 2 (Trial Application):**
- Submit application without premium
- After approval, deliver policy and submit payment authorization
- Receive 100% of commission advance within one week

**Renewals:**
- With Transamerica, our primary carrier, renewals pay 3-5% for approximately 15 years
- Clients must pay 13 months of target premium within 24 months to avoid chargebacks

## Rollover Opportunities

Many of our teams have ambitious rollover goals for 2025—around $20 million. Here's how rollover compensation works:

- Average payout to WFG: 6%
- For a $100,000 rollover at Marketing Director level (50% commission): $3,000 commission
- Most rollovers have no chargebacks

## Points Calculation

**Transamerica:**
- For a $100 monthly premium: $100 × 12 = $1,200 annual premium
- Commission calculation: $1,200 × 62% = $744
- Points calculation: $1,200 × 1.25 = 1,500 points

**Other Insurance Companies:**
- For a $100 monthly premium: $100 × 12 = $1,200 annual premium
- Commission calculation: $1,200 × contract level (e.g., 50% = $600)
- Points calculation: Same as annual premium (1,200 points)

## Building Your Team

As a Marketing Director at 62% contract level with 10,000 annual premium, you earn $6,200 personally. But the real power comes from building a team.

With four solid team members each producing 10,000 annual premium:
- Training Associate (+32% override): $3,200
- Associate (+17% override): $1,700
- Senior Associate (+7% override): $700
- Another Training Associate (+32% override): $3,200

That's $15,000 monthly—putting you on pace for $180,000 annually as a Marketing Director!

## SMD Earnings Potential

As a Senior Marketing Director with 50,000 base shop points (20,000 personal) at 80% contract:
- Personal commission: $16,000
- Team override (35% average on 30,000 points): $10,500
- 3% SMD bonus: $1,500
- Total monthly income: $28,000 ($336,000 annually)

By developing three additional SMDs, each producing 50,000 points:
- $8,500 override per SMD: $25,500 monthly
- Combined with your base shop income: $53,500 monthly ($642,000 annually)

Building ten key SMDs can generate over $1.5 million annually!

## Additional Bonuses

WFG offers six different bonus programs:
- Base shop bonus
- Super base bonus
- Super team bonus
- Advisory base bonus
- Advisory super base bonus
- Advisory super team bonus

We also receive quarterly consistency bonuses: $8,000 for maintaining 50,000 points for three consecutive months, or $16,000 for maintaining 100,000 points.

## Your Action Plan

Success in this business is simple, but requires consistent execution:
1. Book 10 kitchen table presentations weekly
2. Expect 50% to cancel
3. Close 50% of the appointments you conduct
4. Target $1,000 in monthly premium

This approach yields:
- Training Associate: $3,600 monthly
- Associate: $5,400 monthly
- Senior Associate: $6,600 monthly
- Marketing Director: $7,400 monthly
- Senior Marketing Director: $9,600 monthly

If you feel you've exhausted your market, create one new Top 25 list weekly. From each list, you'll typically recruit one person, and about half will become licensed. These new team members bring fresh markets and opportunities.

## Promotion Guidelines

Fast-track promotions:
- Associate: 3 sales, 3 recruits, 30 days
- Senior Associate: 10 sales, 10 recruits, 30 days
- Marketing Director: 25 sales, 25 recruits, 30 days

Traditional promotions:
- Associate: 20,000 points in 90 days

- Marketing Director: 5 licensed agents, 40,000 net points over 3 months
- Senior Marketing Director: 10 licensed agents, 3 direct legs, 75,000 base net points, $35,000+ over 12 months

## Executive Bonuses

- EVC bonus: $10,000-$25,000 annually
- SCBC bonuses: $50,000-$200,000 annually plus a Presidential Rolex
