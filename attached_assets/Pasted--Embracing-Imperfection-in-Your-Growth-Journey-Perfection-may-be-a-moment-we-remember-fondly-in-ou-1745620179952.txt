# Embracing Imperfection in Your Growth Journey

Perfection may be a moment we remember fondly in our lives. However, true growth and human perfection are actually found in those imperfect moments—when challenges arise and things aren't going your way.

Unfortunately, I've noticed many MDs, SLs, SMDs, and others stalling their growth while waiting for the "perfect moment." Here's what you need to understand: Your SMD protected you, making conditions appear perfect while they were the ones facing the pain points necessary for base shop growth.

When you become an SMD yourself, remember: you are not weak—you're now the parent. Just as parents never show the hardship and pain of life to their children until they're old enough to experience reality, SMDs must be the Superman, the Supermom, the superdad for their base shop and people. Yet sadly, many shy away from this responsibility.

## The Passive Life Problem

I've learned that a passive life delivers passive results. Remember the saying: "If you're casual, you'll become a casualty." In our business, too many people fold at the first sign of challenge or when things don't go as planned.

Many operate with the "mañana syndrome"—the "tomorrow" mindset—where if something doesn't happen now, there's always next time. But when next time comes, the same problem persists because you haven't changed your mindset.

Think about people who constantly rearrange their furniture believing the energy in their home will change based on feng shui. They forget it's not about the couch or furniture placement—it's about the person bringing energy into that home. Your spirit and presence matter most. You can rearrange furniture endlessly, but if the same person with the same thinking and devotion remains, nothing truly changes.

Similarly in business, many believe "If not this month, next month will be different." But next month isn't different because you're still the same person. The calendar changing doesn't automatically change everything—YOU need to change with it. How will you be different tomorrow compared to today? Only then will tomorrow be better than yesterday.

Every day is indeed new, but if you approach a new day with the same negative attitude as yesterday, nothing changes. Is this making sense?

## The Power of Inner Dialogue

The Bible says, "As a man thinketh, so is he." What you think about yourself becomes your reality. We all must change our inner dialogue:

* Change "This is hard" to "This is simple, but not easy"
* Change "I don't know how" to "I'll find a way"
* Change "I'm not good enough" to "I'm getting better every day"

Small changes in wording can transform your life and bring peace and enjoyment to your business.

One of my biggest philosophies: the day you stop having fun with this business is the day you're done. Just like in life—many people understand that when they stop being active or having fun at 65 or 70, they start dying. In entrepreneurship, regardless of struggles, frustrations, or victories, the moment you stop having fun is when you're finished.

## Keys to Success at Any Level

Whether you're an SCBC or a DA, success requires:

1. **Remain coachable** – Coachability is the ability to follow. Every great leader is first a great follower. There's nothing wrong with being a follower when necessary, and you learn to be a good leader by following good leaders.

2. **Remain teachable** – Be a student of the business no matter your position. The day you feel you know everything is when growth stops blessing you with learning. As long as you remain a student, you'll continue to learn. Those struggles and setbacks aren't failures—they're learning opportunities.

3. **Maintain hunger** – Develop an inner desire to win. Hunger comes from either dissatisfaction or significance:
   - Early in business, excitement comes from dissatisfaction with your current situation
   - As you achieve goals, hunger must shift to significance—finding purpose beyond yourself

4. **Think big, talk big, do big** – If you think big, you'll talk big. If you talk big, you'll do big. Conversely, if you think small, you'll talk small and do small—or nothing at all. Never fear thinking big; fear thinking too small. Small is boring—there's no thrill or challenge in it.

5. **Align yourself with success** – Surround yourself with successful people. Show me your mentor, I'll show you your future. Show me who you hang around with, I'll show you your future. When I spend time with average people discussing casual matters, my thinking becomes small. When I connect with driven colleagues, I become excited and fired up.

## The Unique Opportunity Before Us

Success is the result of small discipline practiced every day—not sometimes, but every day.

In my 19 years, I've never seen our position quite like it is now. Forget the products and companies—I've never seen such momentum in this company and between teams like ours. We have a vision, a line of success, a group of hungry people, a simple and clear system, and programs at every level to support growth.

In my era, I had to wait 6-8 months between conventions to learn what I needed. I had no Power Networker program, no weekly meetings with leaders, no mentors. For the most part, I had to figure things out day by day.

The beauty of life is in the discovery phase—that butterfly feeling, that struggle and gain. Change your perspective on challenges. If you're not being challenged or hitting walls, you're not growing. If you're not occasionally frustrated, you're not growing.

These last couple of weeks, I've been among the most frustrated people. Yet through that frustration, new ideas and solutions emerged. If I didn't have problems, God would have nothing to help me solve.

## Commit to Change

While you're here for the next 24 hours, do yourself and your family a favor: make real commitments and promises to yourself. Success comes from disciplines you maintain and promises you keep to yourself every day.

I've never seen WFG like it is today—stock options, world-class scripts, excellent conventions and training. Conventions every three months give you constant opportunities to grow. Whatever you're not good at, someone at the convention excels in it.

You don't have to be good at everything, but you must be good at bringing people to conventions and letting experts develop them:
- Not good at connecting spirituality? Bring your people to those who can.
- Not good with systems? Johnny and Larry will teach your people.
- Not good at licensing? Someone at convention will show them how.
- Not good at mindset or mental toughness? Cash will help with that.

Stop focusing on what you're not good at. Instead, leverage your strengths and connect with others who excel where you don't. That's what our business is about.

This is a magnificent time in our business. Recognize challenges and have fun with them. Seek the calm in the storm. Without the right mindset, no system matters.

Elevate your emotions. When you feel anxious or nervous, pause for a moment. Take a deep breath. Center yourself. You'll find clarity and be able to move forward.

I appreciate each of you.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
