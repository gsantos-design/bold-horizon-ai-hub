Pablo & Nolly Santiago - Team Leaders

Empowering Families Through The New Art of Living

Nolly Santiago
Nolly Santiago
Marketing Director â€“ World Financial Group

I've spent over two decades in telecommunications, working as an account executive and serving small and medium-sized businesses. Those businesses have always reminded me of my parents â€” hardworking, dedicated, and doing whatever it takes to provide for their families.

Both of my parents passed away far too early. I'm deeply grateful for the sacrifices they made, but they never had the chance to teach me about financial education. The truth is, they didn't know much about it themselves â€” and like many families, we were never shown how to build real financial security.

That changed when I came to WFG. For the first time, I learned how money really works â€” and more importantly, how to protect families from the uncertainties life throws our way.

Now, my mission is simple: to educate and empower others so they can create financial freedom, build multiple streams of income, and protect what matters most. Because every family deserves the knowledge and tools to secure their future â€” before it's too late.

My Story, My Mission

For over 30 years, I served with the NYPD and Orange County law enforcement. I stood side by side with my brothers and sisters â€” protecting strangers, running toward danger, and sacrificing time with my family because that's what the job demands.

The day I survived a major heart attack, I saw a truth I wish I'd known earlier: if I couldn't go back to work, my family would be left struggling. My pension wouldn't have been enough. My 401(k) was filled with hidden taxes and restrictions.

Now, my mission is clear: to protect the protectors. I educate and empower first responders to safeguard their income and build tax-free wealth using strategies the job never told us about.

We've spent our careers protecting the public. It's time to protect our own.

Joseph Santiago
Joseph Santiago
Associate â€“ World Financial Group

I'm excited to join the WFG team â€” a team that's also my family. I earned my investment license right out of high school, and later graduated with a degree in Finance. From day one, I knew I wanted to use my skills to help people take control of their money and their future.

I grew up watching my parents work incredibly hard, sacrificing countless holidays and summers in service to others. That dedication taught me discipline and commitment, but it also showed me a hard truth: without financial education, even the most dedicated people can be left unprotected.

My mission is to build lasting financial wealth, gain true freedom, and create a legacy that lasts for generations. If you have the heart of an entrepreneur and want to build real wealth, let's connect. I've got you, brother.

Christian Santiago
Christian Santiago
Associate â€“ World Financial Group

I'm Christian Santiago. I recently graduated and, like my twin brother Joseph, I've chosen to join my family's mission at WFG. I've always been a bit of an introvert, keeping my circle small, but I'm deeply loyal to the people I care about. Numbers have always been my strength â€” I've loved math for as long as I can remember â€” but what truly grabbed my attention was learning about the power of compound interest.

It wasn't something I was ever taught in school, and my first reaction was: Why isn't this in schools? Everyone should know this. That moment sparked a passion in me to share this knowledge with others â€” especially with the younger generation.

I believe in empowering people to dream again, to rebuild self-belief, and to gain the confidence to create their own financial future. I see this as a new art of living â€” one where we use knowledge, entrepreneurship, and discipline to build not just wealth, but a lasting legacy.

My mission is to help young people understand that they have the power to take control of their money, their choices, and their future â€” starting today.
