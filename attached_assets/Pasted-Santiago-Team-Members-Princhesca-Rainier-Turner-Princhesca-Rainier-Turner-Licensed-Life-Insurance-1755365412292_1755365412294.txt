Joseph Santiago
Joseph Santiago
Associate – World Financial Group

I'm excited to join the WFG team — a team that's also my family. I earned my investment license right out of high school, and later graduated with a degree in Finance. From day one, I knew I wanted to use my skills to help people take control of their money and their future.

I grew up watching my parents work incredibly hard, sacrificing countless holidays and summers in service to others. That dedication taught me discipline and commitment, but it also showed me a hard truth: without financial education, even the most dedicated people can be left unprotected.

My mission is to build lasting financial wealth, gain true freedom, and create a legacy that lasts for generations. If you have the heart of an entrepreneur and want to build real wealth, let's connect. I've got you, brother.

Christian Santiago
Associate – World Financial Group

I'm Christian Santiago. I recently graduated and, like my twin brother Joseph, I've chosen to join my family's mission at WFG. I've always been a bit of an introvert, keeping my circle small, but I'm deeply loyal to the people I care about. Numbers have always been my strength — I've loved math for as long as I can remember — but what truly grabbed my attention was learning about the power of compound interest.

It wasn't something I was ever taught in school, and my first reaction was: Why isn't this in schools? Everyone should know this. That moment sparked a passion in me to share this knowledge with others — especially with the younger generation.

I believe in empowering people to dream again, to rebuild self-belief, and to gain the confidence to create their own financial future. I see this as a new art of living — one where we use knowledge, entrepreneurship, and discipline to build not just wealth, but a lasting legacy.

My mission is to help young people understand that they have the power to take control of their money, their choices, and their future — starting today.
