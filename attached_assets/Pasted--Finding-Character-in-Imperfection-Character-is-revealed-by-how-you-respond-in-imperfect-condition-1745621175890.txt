# Finding Character in Imperfection

Character is revealed by how you respond in imperfect conditions, not perfect ones. True growth and human perfection emerge during challenging moments when things aren't going your way.

Many MDs, SLs, SMDs stall their growth waiting for the "perfect moment." Understand this: your SMD protected you, making conditions appear perfect while they shouldered the pain for your growth. When you become an SMD, you aren't weak—you're now the parent. Just as parents shield children from life's hardships until they're ready, SMDs must be the Superman for their base shop. Unfortunately, many shy away from this responsibility.

## The Cost of Passivity

A passive life yields passive results. "If you're casual, you'll become a casualty." Too many people fold at the first challenge, adopting the "mañana syndrome"—if it doesn't happen now, there's always next time. But next time brings the same problems because your mindset hasn't changed.

Think about people who constantly rearrange furniture believing it will change their home's energy. They forget it's not about the couch placement—it's the person who brings energy into that space. Your spirit and presence determine the atmosphere. You can rearrange endlessly, but if the same thinking remains, nothing truly changes.

Similarly in business, believing "next month will be different" is futile if you remain unchanged. The calendar changing doesn't automatically improve your situation—YOU must change with it. How will you be different tomorrow? Every day is new, but approaching it with yesterday's negative attitude ensures nothing improves.

## Transform Your Inner Dialogue

"As a man thinketh, so is he." What you think about yourself becomes your reality. We must change our inner dialogue:

* Replace "This is hard" with "This is simple, but not easy"
* Replace "I don't know how" with "I'll find a way"
* Replace "I'm not good enough" with "I'm getting better every day"

These small word changes transform your life and bring enjoyment to your business.

The day you stop having fun with this business is the day you're done. Like elderly people who understand that stopping activity hastens decline, entrepreneurs must maintain enthusiasm regardless of circumstances. When you stop having fun, you're finished.

## Five Keys to Success at Any Level

Whether you're an SCBC or a DA, success requires:

1. **Remain coachable** – Every great leader is first a great follower. Learn leadership by following good leaders.

2. **Stay teachable** – Be a perpetual student. The moment you think you know everything is when growth stops. Struggles aren't failures—they're learning opportunities.

3. **Maintain hunger** – Develop an inner desire to win, which comes from either:
   - Dissatisfaction: Early excitement stems from wanting to change your situation
   - Significance: As goals are achieved, shift to finding purpose beyond yourself

4. **Think big, talk big, do big** – If you think big, you'll talk big and do big. Never fear thinking big; fear thinking too small. Small is boring—there's no thrill or challenge in it.

5. **Align with success** – Your environment shapes you. Show me your mentors and associates, I'll show you your future. When surrounded by casual conversation and average thinking, you become small. When connected with ambitious colleagues, you become energized.

## Our Unprecedented Opportunity

Success results from daily disciplines—not occasional efforts, but consistent practice.

In 19 years, I've never seen our position like it is today. The momentum in our company and between teams is unprecedented. We have a clear vision, hungry people, a simple system, and support programs at every level.

In my early years, I waited 6-8 months between conventions to learn what I needed. There was no Power Networker program, no regular leadership meetings, no mentors. I figured things out day by day.

The beauty of life lies in discovery—that butterfly feeling, that productive struggle. Change your perspective on challenges. Without walls to hit and occasional frustration, you're not growing.

These past weeks, I've been intensely frustrated. Yet through that frustration came new ideas and solutions. Problems are opportunities for growth and divine assistance.

## Leverage Collective Strength

While here, make real commitments to yourself and your family. Success comes from disciplines maintained and promises kept daily.

WFG today offers unprecedented resources—stock options, world-class scripts, excellent conventions every three months. You don't need to excel at everything; you must excel at bringing people to conventions where experts can develop them.

Focus on your strengths and connect with others who excel where you don't:
- Not spiritual enough? Others can connect spirituality.
- Not systematic? The Santiago team will teach systems.
- Struggling with licensing or mindset? Convention experts will help.

This is a magnificent time in our business. Embrace challenges and find joy in them. When anxious, pause and breathe deeply. Center yourself to find clarity and move forward.

I appreciate you all.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
